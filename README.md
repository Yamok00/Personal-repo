# Personal-repo
This repository is to document what I learn, exercises I solve. Also, my goals
I hope to come back here a few months later and be happy with my progress
The goal is to become a machine learning engineer, however, I'm also interested in being a data scientist and an AI specialist
I'm interested in the applications of AI in healthcare.
